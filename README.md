# MCKK_Loranet Workshop
Objectives:
1. IoT
2. 3D printing (make anything you can want!)
   - Assembling
   - downlaoding sketUp 2019
   - downloading CReality for printing
   - downloading the model and then printing it.
3. Embeded system Introduction
4. Embeded Programing basics with Arduino
   - Software:
     - Declarationgit push -u origin master
     - Functions
     - Classes and objectsgit push -u origin master
     - adding libraries (.zip or library manager)
     - Board manager
     - Making a math operation code with serial.
5. Using LoraWAN:
   - adding the library LoraWAN via .Zip
   - Adding their own licesne to code
   - Setting up the TTN for Each Device
7. Using raspberry pi for server:
